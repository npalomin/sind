Understanding streets quantitatively

The rich texture of activities and significance associated with streets emphasises the difficulty, but also the potential, of conducting a socio-physical examination of them (Anderson, 1978). Because streets occupy an intermediate position in the environment, at the crossroads of public and private, individual and society, movement and place, built and unbuilt, planning and architecture, special consideration should be given to people, the physical environment, and their relationships.
The investigation of such a complex phenomenon necessitates novel and creative approaches. Our world is becoming increasingly data-driven, which is changing how business is conducted, governance is implemented, and knowledge is created. Understanding how street ecosystems work from a quantitative perspective can supplement traditional qualitative approaches and have the potential of revealing patterns of behaviour that would otherwise be invisible.
