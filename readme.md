#### Settlement form (Lynch, 1981)
> the spatial arrangement of persons doing things, the resulting spatial flows of persons, goods and information, and the physical features which modify space in some way significant to those actions, including enclosures, surfaces, channels, ambiences and objects. Further, the descriptions must include the cyclical and secular changes in those spatial distributions, the control of space, and the perception of it (p. 48).

#### Creative clustering 
> While most of this discourse has been focused at the geographic scale of inter-city competition, demographics and policy, it has long been clear that creative industries do not locate randomly within cities and are sensitive to ‘characteristics of place’ at the neighbourhood scale. While the importance of quality of place to creative clustering is repeatedly acknowledged, the associated micro-spatialities and morphologies remain under-researched [(Wood & Dovey, 2014)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13574809.2014.972346).
